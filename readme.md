# Whitespace
This code was written as part of a General Assembly assignment to teach ourselves something new. 

## Project Code and instructions
This codes pushes ASCII numbers to the heap with associated addresses, then loops through the heap constructing the string and outputting it to the terminal.

navigate to [Whitelips](http://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/), the only whitespace IDE I could find, copy and paste the code, and click run.

## Why did I learn this?
I already know some python and a lot of Java. I know how long that took me to learn, and knew I probably wouldn't get a ton of benefit out of cramming a new web framework or highly semantic language in one day. That's just me though. 

## How were you first made aware of it?
I spent some time googling esoteric languages and came up with [this](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) wiki with a lot of good ones.

## What problem does it solve?
It flips the script on whitespaces. Normally, they're just ignored by the compiler. (be quiet python, nobody asked you!), and this languages operates solely on those whitespaces, ignoring every other character.

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
It solves no real-world problems, but conceptually, it makes you think about your syntax and getting everything perfect. There's no room for error.

### Why does one use it?
Esolangs are notorious for having no real-world applications. Nobody uses this language for anything other than as practice.

## What are the alternatives?
Brainfuck is the closest, or Assembly. Assembly is more high-level, allowing you to actually read what you're writing, and Brainfuck is a little lower-level in that you don't have niceties like a stack or heap.

## What is the history of this technology?
Developed in 2003 by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris, many thought it was an april fools joke gives it's release date, but it is a completely functional language.

## Who is maintaining it?
Probably nobody, but if I can find the source, I'd love to learn to expand on the functionality of the language.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
3/10, the most frustrating language I've ever used. I can't wait to build more things with it. 

## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
* If not for the Whitelips IDE, I don't think I would have been able to use it at all. Character highlighting is super important. 
* There's also the issue of very little documentation. Some exists, but I really had to work through the syntax on my own. Examples were useless. 

## What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
